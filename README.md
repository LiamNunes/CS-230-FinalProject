# CS-230-FinalProject
Final Project for CS-230 Class


-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming room is a video game company. The software they are trying to creat is an application to play a muliplayer game where a image is slowly reveiled and the players compete to guess what it is.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel I did a good job in laying out the design constraints. I tried to think of all the possible constraints the cliuent could have and feel that i came up with some out of the box constraints that will be very helpful to the client.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

analyzing the domain model i think is the most helpful for me when it comes to developing code, its is kind of the blueprint of the code after all.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would change the development requiremnts. I feel I could have done more research and given a more complete list of the development requirments.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I inturpreted the users needs to be: they needed ease of access, fast proformance, and a application that is not boring (they are using it to have fun after all). Considering the users needs is very important, because in order to do the best job you can people need to want to use what you made.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When desiging the software you really need to start from the ground up. start with the concept then thing what parts do i need to get this to work, then branch off each part until you get to a part that will just work with nothing else tyo support it. in this way you can really determine exactly what it is you need in your progam.
